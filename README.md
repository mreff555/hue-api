# hue-api
A complete c++ api for hue products

This project is very much in development so this readme will be frequently updated
as features are added. The intention is to have a functional and easy to use c++ interface
for hue products, with some possible added functionality.  Below are some of the implemented features and the todo list:

Features:

  - JSON Configuration file which can populate and save off up settings.  Could be used
    for lighting settings as well

  - Get and Post and Put methods implemented

  - Auto-connect, hub IP retrieval and authentication (Testing in progress)

  - Local name and descriptions for lights.
